# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm Priyanka and Iâ€™m a Data Analyst with 6 years of experience working with data to deliver actionable insights and drive business decisions. 
In the past year, I transitioned internally within my current organization to a role where I work extensively with SQL and Power BI. This shift has allowed me to further enhance my skills in data visualization, reporting, and database querying.
Iâ€™m passionate about advancing my technical expertise and have created this repository to track my progress, share my work, and showcase my skills to recruiters.

Thank you for visiting! Iâ€™m excited to share my journey and connect with like-minded professionals.
