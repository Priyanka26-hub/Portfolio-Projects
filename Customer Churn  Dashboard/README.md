Insights
1. The Customer churn rate is 55.4% which is a huge chunk of customers, 40049 customers have left.
2. Customers joining in the first 3 months are leaving the company, suggesting that newer customerrs are churning more frequently than long-term customers.
3. Customers with no contract left are churning the most, that might indicate dissatisfaction in the service or better competitor offers.
4. Customers that have raised servive complaints are churning, although interestingly customers that haven't raised any complaints are also churning. This might suggest difficulty in lodging complaints.
